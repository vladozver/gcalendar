### Fake gmail account
```bash
user: doe303790<br/>
pass: qwerty666_<br/>
```

### Server

Server is made using nodejs. To install and run use:

```bash
# cd server
# npm install
# node index.js
```
Dependencies I use are:
		
- cors
- dotenv
- express
- googleapi
- moment

Server got 3 routes:
```bash
- GET  /          - running server message
- GET  /gcalendar - getting reminders
- POST /gcalendar - saving reminder
```

When getting all reminders the result is list with max 10 active reminders, order by start time. Activ reminders are reminders that starts after current date time.

When posting, there is check for posting data. Required data are name, phone, email, date and time. Also there is check for reminder start date time. You can not send reminder wich starts in the past.

### Client

Client is made with vue. To install and run use:

```bash
# cd client
# npm install
# npm run serve
```

Dependencies and technique I use are:
		
- moment, for manipulation with date types data,
- **[Honeypot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Honeypot_(computing))** technique to protect forms against spammers/robots.
- vuelidate, for validating phone number and email,

Vuelidate do not have phone validation, so I made it with Vuelidate helpers using regex:
```js
const phone = helpers.regex("phone", /^[+]{0,1}[(]{0,1}[0-9]{1,4}[)]{0,1}[/\s\-0-9]{6,15}$/);

// 011/3-713-713    PASS
// 063/408-208      PASS
// +381 63 408-208   PASS
// 0800 300 199     PASS
// (750) 932-3498   PASS
```
